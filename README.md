# Math Wave Visualizer

This project is an interactive visualization tool for exploring sine, cosine, and tangent functions using the p5.js JavaScript library. It allows users to adjust parameters and see how changes in amplitude and frequency affect the shape of each waveform.

## Features

- Adjustable sliders for:
  - Amplitude (A)
  - Frequency (B)
- Live formula display:  
  `y(x) = A × sin(Bx)`, `cos(Bx)`, or `tan(Bx)`
- Graph axes include labels in terms of π
- Clickable buttons to switch between sine, cosine, and tangent visualizations
